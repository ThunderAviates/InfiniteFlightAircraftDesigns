# InfiniteFlightAircraftDesigns
Welcome to the Aircraft Designs page. 
On this page, you are free to browse around and upload your own designs.
You will be able to install code and information/items surrounding the aircraft. (Read the "What can I do with the code")
Anything that you decide to upload may be freely spread around the page.
If you spot anyone using any designs uploaded and selling/advertising it as their own, please report it to my Twitter, @ThunderAviates.
Feel free to download these designs, which will have a tag to which Flight Simulator may the design be used for.
If you spot any inappropriate designs or aircraft shapes, sizes or looks, please report them ASAP to the Twitter provided, to make sure that nobody else has to see it.
Have fun browsing around and contact moderaters or me with any comments, questions, or concerns you may have.
